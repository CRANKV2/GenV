## How to Find the Package Name of a Game on Android

If you're looking to add a game to the GenV module, you'll need to know the game's package name. Here are three easy methods to find it:

### 1. Using Google Play Store URL

1. **Open** the Google Play Store on your Android device or web browser.
2. **Search** for the game you want to add.
3. **Select** the game to open the detail page.
4. Look at the URL in the address bar. The package name is the part of the URL that follows `id=`.
   - For example, in `https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.example.game`, the package name is `com.example.game`.

### 2. Using a Third-Party App (App Inspector)

1. **Download** and install an app like "App Inspector" from the Google Play Store.
2. **Open** App Inspector and let it list all the installed apps on your device.
3. **Find** the game in the list or use the search function.
4. **Tap** on the game to see detailed information, including the package name.

### 3. Using Android Settings

1. **Open** the Settings app on your Android device.
2. Navigate to **Apps & notifications** > **See all apps**.
3. **Scroll** to find the game, or use the search feature at the top of the screen.
4. **Select** the game to view app info.
5. Depending on your device, you might see the package name directly on this screen, or you might need to tap on **Advanced**, then **Memory** or similar options to find the package name.
